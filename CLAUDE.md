# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a walking tour application that uses AI to generate guided tours. The project is in its initial stages.

## Development Commands

*Note: This section will be updated as the project structure is established.*

To be added based on chosen technology stack:
- Build commands
- Test commands
- Linting/formatting commands
- Local development server commands

## Architecture

*Note: Architecture documentation will be added as the codebase develops.*

The project structure and technology choices are still being determined. Key architectural decisions to document:
- Programming language and framework
- Data storage approach for tour information
- API design (if applicable)
- Frontend/backend separation (if applicable)
- AI integration approach for tour generation
